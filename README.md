 # React + Vite...


 
WeatherForecast_App project


Basic weather app created using the React framework for JavaScript and the Vite package. Make sure to hover over the icons when running the project to see the tooltips.

The APIs I used in this project are https://openweathermap.org/api for the weather information and for the reverse geolocation information (turning coordinates for longitude and latitude to location name). It only has the single home page with weather info for a specific location (based on user location or the default is set to Mumbai, London,etc).

Getting started :

You will need to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

To start an empty project with Vite use the following command: npm create vite@latest and then follow the prompts to name and select starter project type etc.

.....Dependencies for this project.......
"dependencies": {
    "luxon": "^3.4.4",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "react-icons": "^5.2.1",
    "react-toastify": "^10.0.5"
  },



Once these dependencies are installed then the code can be run by navigating to the correct directory and using the command 
>>>>    npm run dev

Note on API key: Store your API keys in environment variables. This way, the keys are kept separate from your codebase. You can access these environment variables in your React code.
